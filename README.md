Shaky Bird is our class project for CIS 4350 Computer Architecture. The ultimate goal is produce a android game that responds to input from the various sensor devices. To this end, we hope to implement a clone of the ever popular "Flappy Bird" game that can also be controlled by shaking or tilting the device it is being played upon.

This game leans heavily on the open source framework from the book 'Beginning Android Games" by Mark Zechner and the tutorial on Android Game creation found at Kilobolt http://www.kilobolt.com/day-1-introduction-to-android.html
